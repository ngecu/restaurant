          Retro is a small restaurant, firstly opened in the city Chandigarh and then, many other big cities
  in my country India and, is one of the very few options for good food and services in all these
  cities. I chose to make a website for my friend’s business in this assignment.
  Retro
  Retro is a small proprietary business run by a small family. This business was first opened in
  2010. His family loves to make different types of food for their children and relatives. Also, on
  all the big occasions like marriages, birthday parties and many more they make their different
  cuisine by themselves. At that time few of the relatives and neighbors suggest them to open the
  restaurant, it has only small investment.
  At that time, era of globalization was just started, people like to eat different types of food on
  different occasion. Firstly, they started their business with small shop. Then, they started to serve
  the big occasions like marriages, small family functions, birthday parties and many more.
  Retro offers many delicious and mouth-watering dishes at cheaper rates than any other
  restaurant. It also offers huge range of different coffees, tea, pan and shakes, and it not only
  offers its famous freshly baked cakes, biscuits and cookies but also different types of junk food
  like burger, noodles, pizza, Manchurian and many more. Among all these, Pizza is very
  delicious, when we saw it mouth started watering.
  When they open a new big restaurant, they started taking big orders for large parties and
  exploring the business in different cities. Then customer order food on call and they started
  deliveries. Due to this reason, lot many customers attract to this restaurant. They started offering
  many deals to the customers on several festivals and various days just for attracting the
  customers and for increasing the sale. Due to these offers, their popularity was increasing,
  sometimes customers had to encounter difficulties like they had to for half an hour. But they can
  give free delivery to their home so that people cannot feel bad.
  When the business is growing, they started to hire the other people. Firstly, they give proper
  training to them and teaching communication skill like speaks politely and give proper wages to
  the employees and, also give free food to all the employees.
  In these days, due to hard work of the family, it become the one of the biggest restaurants in my
  country. So that’s why I choose to make website so that they can take order online give track
  location to customers so that they can track the food and give proper feedback regarding the
  food, so they can solve the problems if someone have. Moreover, they can take online payment
  from the customers and on the website, I can add many pictures of the food and restaurant to
  attract most of the people and one can apply for job online without coming and giving resume
  ang give online interview. This can save the time for both employees and one who wants job.
